## 2026-08-08 — harness bootstrap

**Established, with evidence, on this machine:**

- realm-core `v14.14.0-3-gf8752e180` configures and builds against Apple clang 21
  once `-Wno-invalid-specialization` is added. Without it the build fails at
  `upstream/src/external/s2/s1interval.h:189` — s2 specializes `std::is_pod`, which
  clang ≥ 21 rejects outright. Fixed in `harness/CMakeLists.txt`, not upstream.
- **The format is deterministic.** All five traces produced byte-identical files
  across two oracle runs. This is the finding the whole strategy rests on; if it had
  gone the other way, byte-identity would not be a usable acceptance criterion.
- File header decoding, confirmed against real output:
  `[0..16)` two top refs, `[16..20)` `T-DB`, `[20..22)` file format version —
  **one byte per slot, not a u16** — `[22]` reserved, `[23]` flags with bit 0
  selecting the live slot for both the ref and the format byte.
  Observed: `ff…ff 38 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 54 2d 44 42 18 18 00 01`
  → slot 1, top_ref 824, file format 24.
- `realm_compact()` before close removes allocator slack whose size otherwise depends
  on transient allocation order. Without it, file size varies run to run.
- realm's default logger writes compaction timings to stderr. Timings vary per run, so
  the runner sets `RLM_LOG_LEVEL_OFF`.

**Assumptions made without asking:**

- Fixed trace schema: one class `T` with `_id` (int pk), `i` int, `s` string,
  `d` double, `b` bool. Chosen to cover the scalar widths realm packs differently.
  Collections, links, and mixed are not yet exercised — that is a real coverage gap,
  and the first thing to extend once a unit touching them is queued.
- `REALM_ENABLE_SYNC=OFF`, `REALM_APP_SERVICES=OFF`, encryption and geospatial ON.
  Encryption stays on because it changes page layout even when unused.

**Known gap:** no unit has been ported, so `make diff-test` passing proves the harness
works, not that any Rust is correct. The harness has never failed on this machine
except under a deliberate negative control (comparing two different traces' output,
which correctly reported divergence at offset 8).

## 2026-08-08 — Phase 0 complete, verified

`make verify` exits 0. Full chain: doctor → oracle → hybrid → determinism-check →
diff-test → format-compat → fault-check.

**Two real bugs found and fixed during setup, both of the silent-green kind:**

1. **Arch mismatch.** This shell runs under Rosetta (`uname -m` = x86_64) while rustc
   is native aarch64. cargo produced an arm64 staticlib, cmake produced an x86_64
   binary, and `ld` **dropped the archive with only a warning and exited 0**. The
   hybrid was silently pure C++ — diff-test would have passed forever while testing
   nothing. Fixed by deriving the Rust triple from `uname -m` in the Makefile.

2. **Archive member never extracted.** Even with matching archs, ld only pulls an
   archive member that resolves an undefined symbol. Nothing referenced the probe, so
   it stayed absent. Fixed with `HARNESS_HYBRID` + an explicit reference in
   trace_runner. `make hybrid` now greps the linked binary for the probe symbol and
   fails the build if it is missing.

The general lesson, worth remembering: **every failure mode found so far during setup
was a false green, not a false red.** Design new checks assuming that is the default.

**`make fault-check` added.** Builds a third stack with one written integer off by one
and requires diff-test to catch it. Result: 5/5 traces caught it. This is the answer to
"how do I know the gate works" and it now runs as part of `make verify`.

**format-compat:** 14 legacy fixtures agree across both stacks, 9 rejected by both
(too old, or need sync history), 0 disagreements.

**queue.md generated:** 103 translation units under `upstream/src/realm/` excluding
object-store/sync/parser/exec/tools/metrics. 14 are depth-0 (no realm-internal
includes) and can be ported without a shim.

**Coverage gap, recorded deliberately:** the trace schema is scalar-only (int, string,
double, bool). No collections, links, Mixed, or Decimal128. Also, `realm_compact()`
runs before every close, so no trace compares an uncompacted file — a free-list bug
that compaction erases would slip through. Both need new traces before any unit
touching them is ported.

## 2026-08-08 — unit 1: `util/base64.cpp`

`make verify` exits 0. `migration/checks/run_base64_differential.sh` exits 0 on
15,293 probe lines. ~2 hours.

**This unit cannot be judged by `make diff-test`, and that is the main thing to carry
forward.** base64 never reaches a `.realm`: every call site (`to_json.cpp`,
`uuid.cpp`, `util/serializer.cpp`, `util/bson/bson.cpp`, plus the disabled sync/app
code) consumes the result as text. A correct port and a wrong one produce identical
files, so diff-test would have gone green over an arbitrarily broken implementation.
The gate still had to pass — it proves the link is intact and nothing else moved —
but it is not the evidence.

The evidence is `migration/checks/`: one driver compiled twice, once against
`build/oracle/.../base64.cpp.o` and once against `librealm_core_rs.a`, dumps compared
byte for byte. **It caught a real bug on the first run** (below). Expect more units
like this — anything under `util/` that only produces strings needs its own
differential, and "diff-test is green" should not be written in this file as if it
settled the question.

### The bug the differential caught

`base64_decode_to_vector` ends with `decoded.resize(*actual_size)`, which reads as a
pure shrink. It is not. `base64_decode` can report **one byte more** than
`base64_decoded_size()` reserved, and then `resize` grows and reallocates.

The trigger: `4k` valid characters followed by exactly one `=`, no whitespace. The
four-character groups emit `3k` bytes; the lone `=` sends the tail through the
`num_trailing_equals == 1` branch, which emits two more; `3k + 2` against a
reservation of `(3(4k+1)+3)/4 = 3k + 1`. `"="`, `"AAAA="`, `"AAAAAAAA="` … all hit
it. Every other mix of valid characters, padding and whitespace fits, because
whitespace only inflates the input length and therefore the reservation. So the
overrun is exactly one byte, and it is a one-byte heap overflow in upstream's
Release build — the `REALM_ASSERT_EX` that would have caught it is compiled out.

My first version assumed shrink-only and returned a vector with `end` one past `cap`.
The differential reported `cap=2` vs `cap=1` on the very first run. Nothing else
would have found it: the *contents* were identical, because C++'s reallocating grow
copies only the old `size` bytes and value-initialises the tail, so the byte that
overran is discarded and the last byte is `0` in both stacks.

Mirroring `libc++`'s `__recommend()` was then required, and `max(2*cap, new_size)` is
not the whole function — there is a `max_size()` clamp above `PTRDIFF_MAX/2`.

### Format / ABI decisions found (verified against the built oracle object)

None of these are on-disk layout — this unit has none — but they are the C++ ABI
facts the next `util/` unit will need, and they were read off
`build/oracle/.../base64.cpp.o`, not assumed:

| C++ type | layout | passing |
|---|---|---|
| `Span<T, dynamic_extent>` | `{T* data; size_t size}`, 16 B | 2 GPRs, trivially copyable |
| `std::optional<size_t>` | value @0, `bool` @8, 16 B | returned in `rax`:`dl` |
| `std::vector<char>` (libc++) | `{begin, end, cap}`, 24 B, no SBO | — |
| `std::optional<std::vector<char>>` | vector @0, `bool` @24, 32 B | **sret** in `rdi` |

Read straight off the disassembly: `base64_decode`'s `none` path is
`xorl %eax,%eax; xorl %edx,%edx`, its engaged path ends `movb $0x1,%dl`.
`base64_decode_to_vector` takes the sret pointer in `rdi` with the Span in `rsi:rdx`.

Two more that will recur:

- **Buffers handed to C++ must come from `operator new`.** `base64.cpp.o` imports
  `_Znwm` and the *unsized* `_ZdlPv`; the returned vector is destroyed by C++, so a
  Rust-allocator buffer would be freed by the wrong allocator. Declared as
  `extern` `_Znwm`/`_ZdlPv` rather than using `std::alloc`.
- **An empty `std::vector<char>` is three null pointers, not a zero-size
  allocation.** `vector<char> v(0)` allocates nothing. Returning a heap pointer for
  the empty case diverges on `capacity()` and hands C++ a block it never asked for.

### Assumptions and deliberate deviations

- **One deliberate deviation from the C++:** the decode buffer is allocated with one
  spare byte (`DECODE_OVERRUN_SLACK`) so the mirrored one-byte overrun stays inside
  its own allocation. Capacity is still reported as `max_size`, so nothing observable
  changes — proven by the differential, which compares size, capacity, contents and a
  checksum. The "mirror the C++ even where it looks wrong" rule exists to protect
  on-disk layout; no byte here reaches a file, so honouring it literally would have
  meant shipping a new heap overflow for nothing. Recorded here because it is the
  first time that rule has been knowingly bent.
- `REALM_ASSERT`/`REALM_ASSERT_EX` are no-ops in this build (`REALM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS`
  off, `REALM_DEBUG` undefined) — confirmed by the absence of an undefined
  `realm::util::terminate` in the object. Mirrored as `debug_assert!`, which is
  likewise absent from the `--release` staticlib. **This means release arithmetic can
  overflow exactly as the C++ does**, so the size helpers use `wrapping_*`. Note the
  workspace sets `overflow-checks = true` in `[profile.release]`, so a plain `+` there
  would have panicked instead of wrapping.
- `panic = "abort"` in the workspace profile means a `std::bad_alloc` thrown by
  `operator new` inside `base64_decode_to_vector` aborts rather than propagating to
  the C++ caller, which the C++ (not `noexcept`) would allow. The function is declared
  `extern "C-unwind"` so the intent is recorded in the signature, but under
  `panic=abort` the behaviour differs from upstream under OOM only. Left as-is rather
  than changing a deliberate workspace-wide safety setting for one unit.
- Two decode-table quirks preserved on purpose, both of which change which inputs are
  accepted: **carriage return (0x0D) is invalid, not whitespace** — only tab, LF and
  space are skipped — and the table silently accepts the URL-safe alphabet (`-` → 62,
  `_` → 63). Transcribed verbatim and covered by unit tests so a later "cleanup"
  fails loudly.
- The `extra = input.size() % 4` fallback counts *all* input characters including
  whitespace and `=`, not just the valid ones. Mirrored as-is; the differential feeds
  whitespace-injected inputs specifically to pin this down.

### How the hybrid actually excludes the C++ — not what the CMake comment says

`harness/CMakeLists.txt` claims the replaced C++ TUs "are excluded in that crate's
build.rs". There is no build.rs and there could not be: cargo cannot reach into the
CMake target. **No build-system change was needed, and none is possible** —
`harness/**` and the `Makefile` are permission-denied, by design.

What actually happens is link order. The hybrid link line is

```
trace_runner.o  librealm-ffi-static.a  librealm_core_rs.a  …  librealm.a
```

`base64.cpp.o` lives in `librealm.a`, at the end. `ld` extracts an archive member
only to resolve a still-undefined symbol, so once the Rust object has defined
`base64_encode` the C++ member is never pulled. Confirmed: `nm build/hybrid/trace_runner`
has no `g_base64_chars` / `g_base64_encoding_chars`, and the three symbols sit at the
Rust object's offsets.

What pulls the Rust object in is `trace_runner`'s reference to
`realm_rs_units_ported()`. **That only covers the codegen unit holding the probe.** A
ported unit that landed in a different CGU would never be extracted, `librealm.a`
would supply the original C++, and every outward sign would still look like success —
probe present, link clean, diff-test green. Added `codegen-units = 1` to
`[profile.release]` for exactly this reason: it collapses the crate to one object, so
"the probe is linked" and "every ported unit is linked" become the same statement, and
`make hybrid`'s existing `nm` check already tests it.

This is the third silent-green failure mode found in this repo, after the Rosetta arch
mismatch and the unextracted archive member. All three had the same shape: the
*absence* of the Rust was indistinguishable from its presence.

### For the next unit

- Check first whether the unit's output can reach a `.realm`. If it cannot, write the
  differential before writing the Rust — it is where the bugs will be found.
- Get the ABI from the built object (`nm`, `objdump -d`), not from reasoning about
  the Itanium ABI. Ten minutes with `objdump` settled the `optional<size_t>` register
  return that would otherwise have been a guess.
- Anything returning an STL container by value is a real ABI port, not a signature
  translation. Budget for it: `std::vector`'s layout, its allocator, its growth
  policy, and the empty-vector special case were four separate decisions here.

## 2026-08-08 — bootstrap report, `util/misc_ext_errors.cpp` parked, `disable_sync_to_disk.cpp` ported

Two units' worth of queue, one unit ported. About 40 minutes, most of it spent on the
finding below rather than on any Rust.

### The queue orders by portability; the gate rewards observability

`gen_queue.py` sorts leaves-first by dependency depth and size. Both are good proxies
for *how hard a unit is to port*. Neither says anything about *whether porting it can
be checked*, and under a byte-identity gate that is the property that decides whether a
green result carries information.

Queue #1, `util/misc_ext_errors.cpp`, turns out to be dead code here: all 33 consumers
are under `sync/`, and sync is OFF. It compiles into the `Storage` archive and the
linker never extracts it —

```
$ nm build/oracle/trace_runner | grep -i MiscExt
(no output)
```

— so `make diff-test` would go green for *any* implementation, including an empty one.
Parked, with the full analysis in `migration/blocked/util-misc_ext_errors.md`.

**Seven of the thirteen depth-0 units are dead this way** (#1, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #9).
The cheap test is: take the unit's `.o`, list its defined symbols, and intersect with
`nm` of the linked binary. Empty intersection means the gate is blind to that unit.

That link-level test beats grepping for consumers, which I tried first and which gets
`util/bson/regular_expression.cpp` wrong: it has 20 consumers outside `sync/`, all in
`bson`, which is itself unreachable with `REALM_APP_SERVICES=OFF`. Transitive deadness
is only visible at the link.

### `disable_sync_to_disk.cpp` — live, but still byte-invisible

Ported instead, as the first genuinely reachable unporte unit (2/2 symbols linked).
Two functions over one `std::atomic<bool>`.

Format decisions: **none**. Nothing in this unit reaches the file. All five call sites
(`db.cpp:1680`, `alloc_slab.cpp:{839,1509,1532}`, `group_writer.cpp:1402`) use the flag
only to decide whether to *flush*. So this unit is executed — unlike `misc_ext_errors`
— but a wrong return value would still produce a byte-identical `.realm`.

Worth being precise about the distinction, because the two failure modes need different
mitigations: `misc_ext_errors` is **unreachable** (no test can ever reach it while sync
is off), `disable_sync_to_disk` is **reachable but byte-invisible** (executed on every
trace, but its effect is on `fsync` timing, not content).

The one thing the gate *did* prove: link-order replacement still works with two units
in the crate. The C++ TU's anonymous-namespace global is present in the oracle and
absent from the hybrid, where only the Rust static appears:

```
oracle: __ZN12_GLOBAL__N_122g_disable_sync_to_diskE.0
hybrid: __RNvNtCs…_13realm_core_rs20disable_sync_to_disk22G_DISABLE_SYNC_TO_DISK.0
```

### Assumptions

- **Memory ordering mirrored, not optimised.** C++ `g = disable` and `return g` on a
  `std::atomic<bool>` are `store`/`load` with `memory_order_seq_cst`, so the Rust uses
  `Ordering::SeqCst`. `Relaxed` would behave identically on every platform realm
  targets and would be the idiomatic choice; mirroring the C++ is the rule, and this is
  a cheap place to honour it rather than a place to start making exceptions.
- **No `migration/checks/` differential for this unit**, deviating from last session's
  "if it cannot reach a `.realm`, write the differential first". The advice is right for
  something like base64 — 582 lines, alphabet edge cases, padding rules. Here the entire
  observable contract is two atomic operations on one bool, and the Rust unit tests
  cover it exhaustively (default false, round-trip both ways, store-not-latch). A
  208-line differential harness to compare a bool getter against a bool getter would be
  ceremony, not evidence. Flagging the deviation rather than quietly skipping it.

### For the next unit

- **Run the reachability check before reading the C++.** One `nm` intersection, and it
  reorders the whole queue. Doing it first would have saved this session's detour.
- The first live, byte-*visible* units are `string_data.cpp` (#12, inbound 14) and
  `error_codes.cpp` (#13). `string_data` is where element width starts to matter and is
  the first unit where `make diff-test` becomes a real test rather than a regression
  check. `backtrace.cpp` (#10) and `basic_system_errors.cpp` (#8) are live but, like
  this unit, likely byte-invisible.
- Recommended: give `gen_queue.py` a reachability column and sort dead units to the
  back. Without it the loop parks #1, #3, #4 and halts on its three-consecutive-parks
  rule — the right behaviour for the wrong reason, three iterations late.
